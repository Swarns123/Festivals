    <div align="center"><font face = "Arial" color="white">Holi, Hindu spring festival celebrated throughout North India on the full-moon day of Phalguna (Februaryâ€“March). Participants throw coloured water and powders on one another, and, on this one day only, license is given for the usual rankings of caste, gender, status, and age to be reversed. In the streets the celebrations are often marked by ribald language and behaviour, but at its conclusion, when everyone bathes, dons clean white clothes, and visits friends, teachers, and relatives, the ordered patterns of society are reasserted and renewed.</font><br><br>
