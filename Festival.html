	Festivals are an expressive way to celebrate glorious heritage, culture and traditions.  They are meant to rejoice special moments and emotions in our lives with our loved ones.  They play an important role to add structure to our social lives, and connect us with our families and backgrounds. They give us a distraction from our day to day, exhausting routine of life, and give us some inspiration to remember the important things and moments in life.  Festivals were started to pass the legends, knowledge and traditions onto the next generation.

All festivals are cultural in one way or another.  There are many types of cultural festivals such as National, Religious and Seasonal.  They all serve the purpose of bringing happiness to our lives, and strengthen our sense of community.<br>
